# Russia
I was analyzing a data set of the crimes that happened in Russia from the years of 2003 - 2020. I got the dataset from Kaggle and I used python to analyze what was going on. I did some value of counts of the variables, minimum and maximum of some of the variables, and I made some visualizations. I made a graph of the total number crimes that happened in 2003 and see how much it increased and decreased by. I also made a graph of the total number of crimes that happened in 2019 as well. I also made other graphs relating to that of total crimes. I also had a couple of histograms. I had one histogram where it showed how frequency of some of the total crimes. I also had a another histogram of how frequency of terroristic crimes.
